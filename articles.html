        <h2>Helping the landlords build their wealth at least with one stress less.</h2>
  </div>
<p>
 Over the past months, with many of us not understanding how economics work or how the monetary and fiscal policy actually have to align in order for the country's economic to thrive, we were just confused over how the taxes and government budgets were adjusted, but mostly as for us together with our partners, the property owners whose bond is still on, we were more shocked over the continuous increase in the repo rate(prime lending rate) which ultimately increased bond repayments leaving many of the property investors cash strapped. To counter the effect of the rise in the cost of property ownership we have introduced revolutionary buy now pay later property maintenance service which will allow for tenants to have their properties maintained with having to pay upfront.</p>

<div class="article-row">
        <div class="article-col">
<h2> Ensuring fairer allocation of their energy cost to the tenants.</h2>
<p> The common unfair practice generally in the township is the contribution for buying the electricity that is to be available 
  for the use of everyone including reckless users in the yard with multiple tenants. Our very first revolutionary product is the
   prepaid electricity meter boxes with installation aims to ensure that the tenant only pays for the electricity that they need to use,
    and never more. And the icing on top... Tenants can buy electricity on credit for month-end payment.

<div class="article-row">
        <div class="article-col"> <h2>Educative content on how to get started with property investment.</h2>
<p>The one other revolutionary product is the content that we will deliver as Zwehanna continually carrying out research activities we
   will deliver content on how average people can actually get started with property investing. When properly delivered our content is
    meant to be educative, entertaining and encouraging engagement for the consumer of the content. Our aim is to create together 
    with the user.</p>

 <p>We hope that the introductory article allows our partners being both the tenants and the landlords see the bigger
   picture just as is portrayed by us. This is the begging of a very harmonious stay and an educative journey.<br>
Asante sana<br<
Your partner Zwehanna</p>
